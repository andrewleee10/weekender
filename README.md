## Description

Ever wanted to just have something to do on the weekend but with no plans? This app is just for you! Our project Weekndr, is a web app where users can post activities to do on the weekend which then allows other users can respond to. It includes a RSVP functionality and a comment section for each post. Each user comes with a profile where the posts they made are listed. This app is the culmination after 8 weeks of our Coding Boot Camp.
